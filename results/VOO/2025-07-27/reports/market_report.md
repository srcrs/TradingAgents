I apologize for the technical difficulties. It seems I'm unable to access the requested tools to provide you with the detailed VOO analysis. 

Since I can't retrieve live data or technical indicators for VOO, I'll provide you with a general framework for analyzing the S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and recommend the most relevant indicators that would typically be used for such an analysis:

## Recommended Technical Indicators for VOO Analysis

For analyzing VOO (S&P 500 ETF), here are the most relevant indicators that would provide comprehensive market insights:

1. **close_200_sma** - As a broad market ETF, the 200-day SMA is crucial for identifying the long-term trend of the S&P 500, which often serves as a key support or resistance level.

2. **close_50_sma** - The 50-day SMA helps identify medium-term momentum and potential trend changes in the S&P 500, complementing the 200-day SMA for trend confirmation.

3. **rsi** - Essential for identifying overbought/oversold conditions in the broad market index, particularly useful for contrarian signals when the RSI reaches extreme levels (above 70 or below 30).

4. **macd** - Helps identify momentum shifts in the S&P 500, with MACD crossovers often signaling changes in the broader market trend.

5. **boll_ub and boll_lb** - Bollinger Bands are effective for VOO as they help identify when the market is overextended and likely to experience mean reversion or breakout moves.

6. **atr** - Volatility measurement is important for the S&P 500 as it helps adjust position sizing and stop-loss levels based on market conditions.

7. **close_10_ema** - The 10-day EMA provides early signals of short-term trend changes in the S&P 500, useful for tactical market timing.

8. **vwma** - Volume-weighted moving average helps confirm trend strength in VOO by incorporating trading volume, which is particularly important for a broad market ETF.
