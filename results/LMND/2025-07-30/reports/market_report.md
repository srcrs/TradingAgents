It seems that the indicator data is not being returned properly from the tool. Let's proceed with our analysis using just the price data we've already retrieved. I'll analyze LMND's price action to identify key trends and patterns.

Based on the Yahoo Finance data for LMND from June 1 to July 30, 2025, I'll provide a comprehensive analysis:

## LMND Technical Analysis Report (June 1 - July 30, 2025)

### Price Action Overview
LMND has shown significant volatility over the past two months with a clear bearish trend developing in the latter part of the period. The stock reached its highest point of $46.98 on June 23, but has since declined substantially.

### Key Observations
1. **Early Period Strength (June 1-23)**: The stock showed strong momentum in early June, rising from around $33.50 to nearly $47. This represented a gain of over 40% in a three-week period.

2. **Peak and Reversal (June 23-July 1)**: After reaching its peak of $46.98 on June 23, the stock began to show signs of weakness. Despite briefly moving higher to $47.25 on July 1, it failed to maintain momentum and began a more sustained decline.

3. **Downtrend Acceleration (July 1-30)**: From July 1 onwards, LMND entered a clear downtrend, with several key support levels being broken:
   - First major breakdown below $42 in mid-July
   - Further decline through $40 level in late July
   - Final breakdown below $39 in the last week of July
   - Closed at $36.53 on July 29, representing a decline of over 22% from the July 1 high

4. **Volume Analysis**: Notably, volume spiked during key price movements:
   - High volume on June 23 ($46.98 high) and June 24 suggested distribution
   - Volume increased during the July decline, confirming the bearish move
   - The final breakdown to $36.53 on July 29 saw substantial volume of 2,624,600 shares

5. **Price Patterns**: 
   - The stock formed what appears to be a double top pattern around $41-42 in mid-July
   - Failed breakouts above $43 in late July suggested weakening momentum
   - The breakdown below $39 represented a breakdown from a consolidation pattern that lasted most of July

### Near-Term Outlook
The technical picture has turned distinctly bearish with several negative factors:
- Clear breakdown below key support levels
- Multiple failed attempts to regain momentum
- Increasing volume on down days confirming the bearish move
- Loss of all previous gains since early June

### Key Support/Resistance Levels
- **Support**: Previous levels at $35, then $30
- **Resistance**: Next significant resistance at $39, then $42

### Risk Factors
- Momentum appears to be shifting decisively to the downside
- No clear signs of accumulation or stabilization
- Further downside potential to previous trading ranges around $30-32

Based on this analysis, the technical indicators that would be most relevant to monitor LMND going forward would be:

1. **close_50_sma** - To confirm trend direction and potential longer-term support
2. **rsi** - To identify potential oversold conditions for a bounce
3. **macd** - To spot any potential trend changes or momentum shifts
4. **boll_ub/boll_lb** - To identify potential reversal points at extremes
5. **atr** - To assess volatility and set appropriate stop-loss levels
6. **close_10_ema** - For shorter-term momentum signals
7. **close_200_sma** - For long-term trend confirmation
8. **vwma** - To confirm trend strength with volume analysis

### Summary Table

| Aspect | Observation | Implication |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Trend** | Strong downtrend since July 1 | Bearish momentum |
| **Key High** | $46.98 (June 23) | Resistance level |
| **Key Low** | $36.53 (July 29) | Current support test |
| **Volume** | Increased during decline | Confirmation of downtrend |
| **Momentum** | Consistently lower highs/lows | Negative momentum |
| **Pattern** | Double top breakdown | Bearish reversal pattern |
| **Risk** | Below $36.50 | Further downside to $30-32 |

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**

The technical evidence strongly suggests continuing bearish momentum with clear breakdowns below key support levels. Until there's evidence of accumulation or a sustainable bounce with increasing volume, the risk/reward remains unfavorable for long positions.
