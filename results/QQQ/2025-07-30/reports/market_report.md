- Closed July at $567.26, down slightly from the July 29th high of $568.14 but still near highs

## Risk Assessment

While the trend is clearly bullish, there are some considerations:
- The strong advance may make the ETF vulnerable to profit-taking
- Limited consolidation periods may suggest an overbought condition is developing
- No significant corrective periods could indicate exhaustion if the trend reverses

- **Support Levels**: $560, $550, $540
- **Resistance Levels**: $575, $580, $590

## Trading Strategy Considerations

1. **Trend Following**: The strong uptrend supports trend-following strategies
2. **Pullback Entries**: Traders might look for buying opportunities on minor pullbacks to support levels
3. **Risk Management**: Stop-losses should be placed below recent swing lows
4. **Position Sizing**: Given the strong momentum, aggressive positioning may be warranted but with appropriate risk controls

## Conclusion

QQQ has demonstrated exceptional strength throughout the analyzed period with a nearly 20% gain from April to July 2025. The technical picture remains bullish with the price maintaining healthy relationships with support levels and moving averages. The consistent upward movement suggests strong institutional demand and positive market sentiment toward tech stocks.

While the trend is strong, traders should remain vigilant for signs of exhaustion or increased volatility that could signal a potential trend change or need for consolidation.
