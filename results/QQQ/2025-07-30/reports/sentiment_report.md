It seems there's a misunderstanding regarding the current date. Since we're analyzing data for a future date (2025-07-30) which hasn't occurred yet, I can't provide real-time social media sentiment or news analysis for that period. However, I can help explain how to conduct such an analysis when the time comes.

For QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust ETF) analysis, here's what would be helpful:

1. **Social Media Monitoring Tools**:
   - Brandwatch or Sprinklr for comprehensive social listening
   - Hootsuite or TweetDeck for Twitter monitoring
   - Reddit tracking for r/investing or r/stocks communities

2. **Financial Sentiment Platforms**:
   - StockTwits for trader sentiment
   - Finviz Elite for social sentiment metrics
   - Bloomberg Terminal or similar for professional sentiment analysis

3. **News Aggregation**:
   - Google Alerts for QQQ and related holdings (especially tech stocks)
   - Reuters, Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance for breaking news

4. **Key Metrics to Track**:
   - Volume of mentions
   - Sentiment polarity (positive/negative/neutral)
   - Key themes or topics
   - Correlation with price movements

When conducting this analysis in the future, you'd want to look at both the overall sentiment toward the QQQ ETF itself and the sentiment toward its major holdings (like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.) since QQQ tracks the Nasdaq-100 index.

Would you like me to help you prepare a framework for this type of analysis that you can use when the time comes?
